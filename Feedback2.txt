Interest of content: Outstanding – Lots of pictures, a twitter feed and short but useful information. Satisfies all requirements of the website easily.
Consistency and quality of visual presentation: Exemplary – Very nice-looking template (appreciate dark mode), lots of images and nicely scaled images. Only downside is Alisha’s images failed to load 
Quality of written presentation: Excellent – Using titles, lists, and splitting text up around the page. Easy to read and in a very readable font and colour. Well written without being too complex
Validity of HTML: Exemplary – Good use of HTML through a template, nothing seems wrong with it at all and good enough to make a clear, well formatted site
Evidence of collaboration: Very Good – Evenly split workload in terms of pushes, however much of it was left until the final few hours before it was due
